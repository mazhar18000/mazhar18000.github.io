<h1>Assignment 8 - Summary</h1>
Session 8b - Internet Fundamentals/Web Accessibility
Activity 1: "W3C Markup Validation Service" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I used the W3C Markup Validation Service to check the HTML structure of a webpage. This tool helps identify coding errors that may impact website functionality and accessibility.[What did you learn about the topic?] While running the validation, I discovered a few common mistakes, including missing closing tags and improper attribute usage. These errors can affect how assistive technologies, like screen readers, interpret a webpage. After making the necessary corrections, the page passed the validation check, ensuring it adhered to web standards. [How do you envision being able to apply the concept to your own current or future environment?] By using this tool in future web development projects, I can ensure my HTML is clean, structured correctly, and accessible to all users. This is particularly important in IT and cybersecurity, where clear documentation and properly formatted web interfaces are essential for usability. 
Activity 2: "WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool" [What activity did you complete?] In this activity, I used the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to analyze a webpageâ€™s accessibility. This tool highlights issues such as missing alternative text for images, low contrast text, and improper heading structures. [What did you learn about the topic?] Through this evaluation, I found that the webpage lacked descriptive alt text for images, which makes it difficult for screen readers to convey image content to visually impaired users. Additionally, some text had poor color contrast against the background, making it hard to read. After adjusting the alt text and improving the contrast, the page became more accessible. [How do you envision being able to apply the concept to your own current or future environment?] Web accessibility is crucial in creating an inclusive digital environment. Moving forward, I will incorporate these checks into any web-related work, ensuring compliance with accessibility guidelines and improving the user experience for all individuals, regardless of disabilities.
