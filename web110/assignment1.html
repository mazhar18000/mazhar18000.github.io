<p></p>Assignment 1 - Internet Fundamentals (How to Copy Documents to a USB Flash Drive from Your Computer) <br>I learned how to effectively use USB flash drives to store and transfer files. This includes steps like connecting the USB drive, locating files on a computer, copying files to the drive, and safely ejecting it to avoid data corruption. The process is simple on both Windows and macOS, with slight variations, such as using File Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS. I envision to use this concept for secure file transfers in my studies and projects, particularly when working offline. It’s also helpful for backing up Linux configurations or transporting project files when internet access is unavailable./p›
